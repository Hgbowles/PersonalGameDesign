Repository for a game that I want to make to learn C++.

I know the best way to learn a new coding language is to do something you enjoy with it, and I really liked the last game I designed, so I'm gonna go at it again in C++.

concept idea:

Game of Games

dungeon crawler
All the rooms are based off of classic board and/or tabletop games, like Chess, Checkers, Scrabble, Parcheesi, The Game of Mao, Solitaire, and so on.

Enemies and puzzles will follow the rules of the game that inspired the room they appear in.

Character design will be based on Dungeons and Dragons, with mechanics including Armor Class, player Ability Stats, and Weapon Damage to reflect such inspirations.

The Game Of Mao is a card game where the rules are unknown to the players except for the Mao Master. The only way to learn the rules is to break them and be punished. Typically, when someone wins a hand of Mao, they become the new Mao Master and make up a new rule to add to the game. As the game develops, more and more rules are introduced to the game.
