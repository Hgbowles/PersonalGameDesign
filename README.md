Repository for a game that I want to make to learn C++.

I'm not sure what the type of game will be yet.

I know the best way to learn a new coding language is to do something you enjoy with it, and I really liked the last game I designed, so I'm gonna go at it again in C++.

potential game ideas include:

   a Roguelike Dungeon Crawler
   a turn-based fighting game

concept idea:

Chesslike Dungeons

dungeon crawler
all the enemies are chess pieces, with different behaviors based on the piece
similar to shotgun king in that the player is the King and can get powerups

turn-based combat sequences with enemies
